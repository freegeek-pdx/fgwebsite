WP Hive allows multiple Wordpress blogs to share the same core files, plugins, and themes.

== Description ==

WP Hive is a WordPress Plugin that allows multiple Wordpress Blogs to use the same core files, plugins, and themes.

This plugin is currently intended to be used in a multi-blog, single administrator environment.  It is built with ease of use and resource sharing at the forefront. WP Hive is for the blogger who manages many blogs and is looking for a simple way to synchronize the plugins, themes, and files for all their blogs at once. If you are looking to run a blog network where you (or a group of trusted individuals) administer and control all the blogs' content, then WP Hive is perfect for you.

WP Hive currently allows users to create new blogs on separate domains and on subdomains.  Having a separate blog on a subdirectory is currently in the works and is expected to be supported within the next few releases.

Be sure to read the installation instructions, since the procedure is a little different than for most plugins.
