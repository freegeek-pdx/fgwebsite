Creates a new view for all pages in your administration "pages" panel. 

== Description ==

Do you have a WordPress site with lots of pages in a hierarchical structure? Are you trying to use WordPress like a "real" CMS? Then this plugin is for you!

Page Tree gives you a much-needed overview of your published pages in the admininstration panel using a common expand/collapse menu, which lets you navigate your page structure like a folder tree in Windows Explorer.

Now you can quickly and easily find the page you want to edit using the expandable tree view, and also get an admin view site map of your complete site.

The page tree is only displayed in WordPress administration panel, under your regular "Pages" menu. See the screen shot for a better understanding of how it works. 

Changes:

1.4 Removed short tags for better compatibility

1.3 Bugfix for fresh install of 2.7.1

1.2 Minor bugfix to prevent empty tree if there are no nested pages.

1.1 Added unpublished pages to the page tree. Pages that are unpublished/drafts/future will now be shown in the tree, but with a strike-through to let you know that they are not published.

1.0 First stable version of plugin.

== Installation ==

Quick and easy installation:

1. Upload the folder `wppagetree` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin actually do? =

This plugin simply provides an easier way for administrators/authors to navigate a large collection of pages in your WordPress installation. It adds a new submenu to your "pages" navigation menu which takes you to a list of all your published pages in a collapse/expand tree. 

= But what about showing the tree on my site? =

Good thinking. Next version of this plugin will most likely have template support so you can display the same tree on your public site.

= I can't see my unpublished/hidden pages! =

Yes you can, if you upgrade to version 1.1. 

== Screenshots ==

1. The page tree in action
2. New option in your pages administration panel

== Wishlist / Coming attractons ==

Here are a few things I want to add to the next version of Page Tree. Do you have suggestions? Feel free to contact me at mans@mansjonasson.se
