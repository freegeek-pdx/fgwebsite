Tags: rss, atom, feeds, listings
Requires at least: 1.5
Tested up to: 2.5
Stable tag: 2.22.3

Allows you to display lists of links from an rss or atom feed on your blog.

== Description ==
	This plugin fetches RSS or ATOM feeds from the url you provide and displays them on your blog. It can be used to manage "hot links" sections or anything else you can grab via an RSS or ATOM feed.

	The plugin also supports wordpress filters by letting you embed a feed into your post.


	The initial idea for this plugin came from the del.icio.us plugin that can be found at http://chrismetcalf.net. -

	Secondary inspiration for the ATOM integration comes from James Lewis at http://jameslewis.com - I had been thinking about doing it and he did it which pushed me to make the integration.



== Installation ==
	INSTALLATION:

	1.) Place the plugin (feedlist.php) in your wp-content/plugins/ directory.

	2.) Edit feedlist.php and fill out the values in the CONFIGURATION section.

	3.) Enable the feedList plugin in the "Plugins" section of your WordPress administration panel.

	4.) OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Replace the class-snoopy.php file in your wp-includes directory with the one provided in this distribution.  The standard class-snoopy.php is broken
	when trying to load pages that are compressed by their server (gzip compression).  This file fixes that problem.


	UPGRADING:

	1.) jot down your configuration information in feedList.php 

	2.) Overwrite your feedlist.php file

	3.) Update your feedlist configuration information with that data you wrote down in step 1

	4.) enjoy

	DATE					MODIFICATION						
		AUTHOR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 October 2005			Initial Version						
		Bill Rawlinson - released version 2.0B
							rewrite of rssLinkedList  NOTE a 
major change - the caching is handled 
by Wordpress now so you don't need a 
cache directory.


	06 Nov 2005			Simplified Interface and Rewrite Docs

	15 Nov 2005			Fixed some bugs 

	01 Dec 2005			Fixed a bug where the description wasn't being shown for atom feeds
						and cleaned up the description display code
	24 Jan 2006			Added new parameter to suppress the inclusion of links with an item title

	09 Feb 2006			Removed erronneous line that was preventing feed caching.  Thanks to user Ted.
					also added better internationalization thanks to user Sebastian

	08 Mar 2006			Added new parameter to display the date the feed was updated "show_date" which is false
					by default.

	10 Mar 2006			Added "random feed" capability (see bottom of file for usage).

	12 May 2006			Added new parameter "additional_fields" which really extends what you can show within the output of the feed.

	16 Jun 2006			Added new parameters max_characters and max_char_wordbreak Plus the ability to add translations for some key words that might get inserted in the feed items.

	21 Nov 2006			minor bug fix that caused generated content to not be xhtml compliant - thanks to the owner of "The Swamp" at http://www.guzzlingcakes.com/ for pointing out the problems.
					Am also including the class-snoopy.php fix for wordpress so that sites that gzip compress their feeds can be consumed by feedlist (this is a bug in snoopy that has been fixed)
					this will allow you to pull in feeds from sites that previously didn't work such as ma.gnolia and reddit.com

	14 Apr 2007			Complete rewrite

	22 Jan 2008			Minor Bug fixes (handle show_date, show_date_per_item)

	24 Mar 2008			Added new parameter "show_description_only" which forces the output to only show each items description (will be linked if a link exists in the feed).

== POTENTIAL ISSUES ==
	May not handle internationalization very well.  Has seen very 
limited testing with non UTF-8 encoding.



== USAGE ==
	From anywhere in your WordPress template, call the function 
"feedList(...)", which takes the following parameters (all 
parameters have default values) you can pass in either a named array of parameters or
pass the parameters in order as follows:


	* rss_feed_url (default: "http://del.icio.us/rss") - The URL of the Del.icio.us RSS or ATOM Feed.  Still named rss_feed_url for backwards compatability but will work with ATOM feeds
	* num_items (default: 15) - The number of items to display
	* show_description (default: true) - Whether or not to display the "description" field
	* random (default: false) - Whether or not to randomize the items
	* before (default: "<li>") - Tag placed before the item	
	* after (default: "</li>") - Tag placed after the item	
	* description_seperator (default: " - ") - Between the link and the item
	* encoding (default: false) - Change to true if you are reading in a ISO-8859-1 formatted file.  Basically, if you see a bunch of question marks (?) in your titles set this to true and see if it fixes the problem.
	* sort (default: "none") - takes one of three values; none, asc, desc
			none - doesn't sort and leaves your existing code as is
			asc	 - sorts the results in alphabetic order (by title)
			desc - sorts in reverse alphabetic order (by title)
	* new_window (default: false) - Whether to open the links in a new window or not.
			true - opens links in new window using javascript to attach the "target" attribute to each link in the list	and is thus xhtml strict compliant
			false - opens the links in the current window  (DEFAULT)
			simple - opens links in new window and hardcodes the target="_blank" into the link. NOT xhtml strict compliant this option exists so that you can use it without javascript.  If you also don't want to include the javascript	in your header file update the global setting in rssLinkList.php $showRSSLinkListJS and set it to false.
	* ignore_cache	(default: false) use only under special circumstances such as testing a feed.  Setting to true will get you banned from
			some feed providers if you fetch too often!  If you provide a number (instead of true or false) it will
			use that value (in seconds) as the cache timeout setting..
			true - gets a fresh copy if possible: not reccommended as some sites will ban you if you get their feed to frequently
			false - uses the default caching mechanism
			numeric value - a way to overide the cache timeout on a feed-by-feed basis
	* suppress_link (default: false) - Whether to wrap the item title in a link to the item's link url
			true - suppresses the link and wraps the title in a <span>
			false - the default behaviour that is what feedList has always done - if a link exists in the feed item then the title is wrapped in the anchor tag <a href="">.
	* show_date	(default: false) - wheter to show the last date the feed was updated.  If true it shows the date wrapped in a div with the class of "feedDate".
			true - shows the update date like so: "updated: 02 Mar 2006 01:59pm EST" without the quotes wrapped in a DIV with class "feedDate".  If you use this and have your
				feed items shown in a list (<ul>,<ol>) your html page may not validate with a <div> nested in the list.
			false - the default behaviour and is what feedList has always done.  No update date is displayed.
	* additional_fields - lets you enter a list of fields you want to display.  The list of fields needs to be delimited by a tilde (~).  If you want to show a nested field then it needs to be defined as a period/dot delimited item.
			example	using del.icio.us and you want to show the tags associated with the item and the summary of the item -
			feedList(array("rss_feed_url"=>"http://del.icio.us/rss/finalcut",
						   "additional_fields"=>'summary~dc.subject'
						   )
			
			In this example the list of fields is summary and dc.subject - dc.subject drills down into the rss structure to reach the node <item><dc><subject></subject></dc></title> - del.icio.us currently exports the list of tags
			in the dc.subject field.
	* max_characters - The maximum number of characters to return. If you want to show everything, set to 0 (default).
			NOTE: if this is set (non 0 number) then any HTML entities will not be converted back to HTML to make sure your sites HTML doesn't get broken.

	* max_char_wordbreak - Used only if max_characters is NOT 0.  Prevent breaking up words.
			true - we cut on the last space before max_characters. 
			false - cuts right at the max_characters point

	* show_description_only - provides a mechanism for turning off the item titles
			true - suppresses the title and the description separator; forces "show_description" to be true
			false - won't change the behavior of the plugin at all.  (DEFAULT)
				
	FILTER USAGE

		* basic:
			<!--rss:[URL]--> 

			NOTE if you aren't using named parameters with the fitler then ONLY provide the url after the rss: or else it won't work.  Left as rss: for backwards compatability but will work with ATOM feeds as well.

		* NAMED PARAMETERS
			<!--rss:rss_feed_url:=http://del.icio.us/rss/finalcut/wishlist,num_items:=5,random:=true-->

			NOTE when using the filter and named parameters ALL parameters including the URL must be named. Also note that if you are providing different HTML for the before or after parameter you must escape it.  For instance if you want before='<li>' then you must pass before='&lt;li&gt;'  

			Finally note the whole thing must be on ONE line.  No line breaks or else it won't work.




  EXAMPLES:

	NAMED PARAMETER EXAMPLE -- PREFERRED METHOD
		<ol>
		<?php 
			feedList(array("rss_feed_url"=>"http://www.auf-der-hoehe.de/index.php?id=23&type=333&feed_id=71&no_cache=1",
							"num_items"=>10,
							"show_description"=>false,
							"random"=>true,
							"sort"=>"asc",
							"new_window"=>true,
							"show_date"=>true
					)
			); 
		?>
		</ol>

	BASIC
		<ol>
		 <?php 
			feedList("http://del.icio.us/rss/finalcut"); 
		 ?>
		</ol>

		due to the fact that rssLinkList wraps each item with an <li> tag pair by default you need to provide the <ol> or <ul> wrappers	around the function call.


	COMBINING LISTS:

		You can also combine rss calls into one html list simply by wrapping multiple rssLinkList function calls in one set of html list tags.  Notice I only specify the first parameter here.  All parameters have defaults so the only one you really need to provide is the URL.

		<ol>
		 <?php 
			feedList("http://del.icio.us/rss/finalcut"); 
			feedList("http://www.43things.com/rss/uber/author?username=FinalCut");
		 ?>
		</ol>

		since the function, feedList, by default wraps each rss item in <li> tags you will end up with one long list of items to display.

	ENCODING EXAMPLE:

		<ol>
		<?php feedList("http://www.auf-der-hoehe.de/index.php?id=23&type=333&feed_id=71&no_cache=1",10,false,true,"<li>","</li>","-",true); ?>
		</ol>



  NOTE:
	Remember, if you don't want your items to be displayed as an html list - you need to override the default parameters of "before" and "after" in the function call.




	-------------------
	RANDOM FEEDS
	-------------------
	This is a feature that lets you prepopulate a text file in a easy to read format that feedList will use to display your feeds randomly.
	It supports pretty much every option the normal feedList functionality supports but with the added ability of displaying items from multiple feeds
	at one time.

	There are some potential areas where you might have problems using this.
	1. You don't format your feed file properly.
	2. You don't tell feedList the correct location of your feed file.  99% of the time this will be the problem.

	For an example of a feedFile check out the feedFile_example.txt that comes with the plugin. For the absolutely easiest
	means of using this feature just create a copy of feedFil_example.txt and renamte it as feeds.txt and put it in your wp-content/plugins
	directory.

	USAGE:

	SIMPLE: assuming you put your feeds.txt file in the wp-content/plugins directory
		<?php randomFeedList() ?>


	ADVANCED: 
		<?php randomFeedList("feedsToShow=2&itemsPerFeed=3") ?>

		there are ALOT of parameters you can pass into randomFeedList.  I am taking a different approach to it here than I do elsewhere in the feedList plugin.
		If you want to pass parameters they must be passed in as shown separating each additional name/value pair with an ampersand &.  

	
	PARAMETERS
	file - the path to your feedfile (default: '.wp-content/plugins/feeds.txt')
	feedsToShow - the number of feeds to poll from your feedfile (default: 5)
	itemsPerFeed - the number of items to show from each feed polled (default: 1)
	show_description - show the description of each item or not (default: false)
	randomItemsPerFeed - not only can you show random feeds from the feed file but you can also show random items from each feed (default: true)
	beforeItems - what to show before an item  (default: '<li>')
	afterItems - what to show after an item (default: '</li>')
	description_separator - what to show, if the description is displayed, between the item title and the description (default: '-')
	encoding - a weak effort at internationalization support.  If your feeds show up with weird characters try setting this to true (default: false)
	sort - how to sort the feed items by title: asc (ascending order), desc (descending), or none - leave feed in its natural order, typically date of posting (default: none)
	new_window - wheter to open the links in a new window (default: false)
	ignore_cache - wheter to ignore the cached copy of the feed - recommended to leave as false (default: false)
	suppress_link - wheter to remove the link from the title (default: false)
	show_date - wheter to show the date each feed was last updated (default false);
	additional_fields - any additional fields to display with the item.  (default: an empty string)


	
	CRAZY ADVANCED CALLING:

		if you want to specify all of those parameters in one call


		<?php randomFeedList("file=./wp-content/feeds2.txt&feedsToShow=2&itemsPerFeed=3&show_description=true&randomItemsPerFeed=false&beforeItems=&afterItems=&description_separator=::&encoding=false&sort=asc&new_window=true&ignore_cache=200&suppress_link=false&show_date=true&additional_fields=x~y~z.a.b") ?>
