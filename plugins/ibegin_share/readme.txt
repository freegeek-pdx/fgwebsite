== Installation ==

1. Upload the ibegin_share folder into your blog's wp-content/plugins directory (so it should become wp-content/plugins/ibegin_share/)
2. Log into WP admin
3. Head on over to Plugins. It should say iBegin Share - click on Activate (it may take a few minutes to finish)
4. A sub-menu under Plugins will appear. You can customize the appearance via the 'iBegin Share' link

== Customization ==

By default, the iBegin Share appears at the end of every post (before comments). You may choose to disable 'Add iBegin Share to posts' while leaving 'Allow the user of [ibeginshare] in posts and pages' to control where you want the 'Share' link to appear.
